A machine learning-based system that recommends optimal crops based on soil parameters, weather conditions, and environmental factors to enhance agricultural productivity.The model predicts the most suitable crop for a given region to enhance agricultural productivity

## Key Features

- Data Input: Collects soil parameters (N, P, K), climate data, and location details
- ML Models: Implements Random Forest, SVM, and Gradient Boosting algorithms
- Recommendation Engine: Suggests best crops and required fertilizers
- Web Interface: User-friendly Flask web application
